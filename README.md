This is a C++ project that I worked on during the Fall 2017 semester. We worked on this project throughout the class to introduce us to C++ and software engineering with C++. 

Throughout the semester we were tasked with creating a program that took a query document and a library of documents to find the document that is the same reading level as the query document. 

Since completing the project I have worked on my programming skills and can definitely do this all over again in a more efficient and organized manner.
